# CNI-SC
CNI-SC is proposed on a local basis to complete the construction of global causal network.
The "SCI.app" and the "SCI.h" is the C++ code which is more efficient, the usage is to open it in Matlab and add it to the search path, then it can works.
We provide an alarm network data which is "alarm.txt" and use it in the main function. You can directly open the main function and run it with one click.
*Note* In order to avoid MATLAB software crashes caused by CPU overload, please first step multiple times and then use the continue button to complete the code.
